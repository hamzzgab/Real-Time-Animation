# Assignment - 2

## ToDo
[x] Animation** of your simple creature using: (6 marks)
    [x] forward kinematics, and
    [x] IK with one of the following: Analytical solution, CCD, FABRIK or Jacobian

[x] Animation of your complex creature using: (14 marks)
    [x] forward kinematics, and
    [x] IK with one of the following: CCD, FABRIK or Jacobian 


**Animation** details for both creatures:
• For forward kinematics, any kind of hierarchical motion is acceptable;
• For basic IK, e.g., reaching for a point that you move around on the screen;
• For advanced IK, e.g., scripting the motion of end effectors using splines or similar.
• Extra marks for quality of animation, natural movements, complexity of model, etc.
