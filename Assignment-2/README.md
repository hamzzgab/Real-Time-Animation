# Assignment - 2

## About

This is the second assignment for Real-Time Animation (CS7GV5) at Trinity College Dublin. I have implemented Forward and Inverse Kinematics for both Simple and Complex Objects using Analytical and Numerical Methods. For the Numerical method I have implemented the Cyclic Coordinate Descent method referenced from [1].

## Demonstration

The video demonstration for the assignment can be found on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-8GdIWd8g4)
