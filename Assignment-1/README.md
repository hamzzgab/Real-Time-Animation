# Assignment - 1

## About

This is the first assignment for Real-Time Animation (CS7GV5) at Trinity College Dublin. I have implemented Euler rotations to display Gimbal Lock, and to resolve this, Gimbal Lock Quaternions are implemented. Some other extra features include a good-looking model of the plane with its respective textures mapped to it. Furthermore, I have tried implementing First Person View, which is implemented partially.

## Demonstration

The video demonstration for the assignment can be found on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-8GdIWd8g4)
